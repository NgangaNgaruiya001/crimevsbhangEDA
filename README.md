# crimevsbhangEDA

This study was done by Nganga Ngaruiya. It was undertaken in order to research whether there is a relationship and influence of bhang possesion charges to the total crimes cases in Kenya.       
The information collected also shed some light on the counties with the highest crime rate and bhang possession charges per square area and per population size.    
The packages used are
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn


I collected data from wikipedia and the Kenya Police website crime statistics.    
I Cleaned them and merged them together to form a singular data frame droping all the unecessary columns and rows.   
I then proceded to making new relevant columns that help me calculate rates which I used to answer the research objectives, which were:
- Find out the county with the highest crime rates (per 10000 people and per 10km2) and also for the crimes we are interested in, in this research
- The distribution of Bhang possesion charges per 10000 people and per 10km2
- Correlation between bhang and crime rates (per 10000 people and per 10km2) and also for the crimes we are interested in, in this research
- Check the influence of bhang to crime rates

I used 2020 data since the 2019 data did not have the drugs data seperated countywise
